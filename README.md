## Statement of Purpose

The terminal application built is for people like myself who forget passwords or are to busy 
with other things to make a password and remember it themselves. This application will create, save,
store, ****(if the gem works) judge/rate the security of the password and help you keep everything in a single place.
The reason for making this application as stated previously is many people seem to forget passwords and have them saved
in very reachable places for people who should not know those given passwords, an application such as this would help 
eliminate atleast a portion of these issues at the least. Again the application will; store, generate and save usernames and
passwords. People who are forgetful, suffer with ADHD or other forms of attention deficit and the general busy population 
are the ones this application has been made for. Those with ADHD have a tendancy to forget very easily and therefore this 
app will help sort thier passwords and usernames for them without the silly post-it notes all around with sensitive data.
Forgetful people hopefully will not forget about the app but very similariry with ADHD will be able to keep everything stored.
The general busy populace will have all thier private passowrds and usernames in one place where it can be accessed without wasting
extra energy and time trying to find them.

### Scope

It is a rather small application that should be able to create a user, save usernames and passwords under that user
